### Purpose of this paper:  

This paper proposes an approach for investigating the behavior of faults to the resources in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) that are prone to failure. Authors construct a redundant Petri net model for a target element that is prone to failure in order to synthesize a fail-safe controller for the system and make it able to continue performing its duties when a target element fails and is under repair or maintenance.  

Simulation-based tool is developed to ensure the correctness, accuracy, and validity of the proposed method using a practical example.  

## Executable Model

In order to run the executable model open the [petrinet_application_example.pn](./petrinet_application_example.pn) file using [Visual Object Net++](https://www.r-drath.de/Drath/Home/Visual_Object_Net++.html) application.
